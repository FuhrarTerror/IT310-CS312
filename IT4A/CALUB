My name is Nap Joseph Calub.
People say I am a very mysterious man.
I love to eat my fruits and vegetables.
My favorite fruits are pineapples and grapes and oranges and watermelons.
I also love turtles and they love me back in return.
I visit the local zoo at least twice a week just to see the turtles.
Sometimes I imagine myself to be one of those wonderful shelled creatures.
If I have my own shell I would use it to make a living.
My favorite Pokemon is Squirtle.
I love Pokemon.
